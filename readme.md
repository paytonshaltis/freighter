## Changing Carousel Properties

The following is a table that details exactly which Carousel properties can be changed, if changing them is currently implemented, and whether or not it is an expensive operation (expensive meaning the instantiation of a new Carousel object that will replace the current).

| Property                           | Changeable | Implemented | Inexpensive |
