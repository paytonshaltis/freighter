# Resizing

Use built-in resizing methods to dictate how your carousel should behave on different screens.

## Generalities

Although there are a number of different resizing methods available to you, they all share some common requirements, restrictions, and capabilities.

Firstly, a carousel **requires** a resizing method. If you do not provide one for the constructor, you will be met with an exception. Note from the getting started sections that this is one of 3 required properties for creating the simplest carousel.

Secondly, resizing methods are **not** dynamic.

## None

The simplest method that you can use for resizing a Freighter carousel is `none`.
